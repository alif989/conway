He called these guys and within 10 minutes this awesome and super friendly guy drove here AND unlocked it with zero damage! 20/10 would recommend! Excellent and friendly service! I used to be bad about locking my keys in my car and never have I ever had someone show up when they said they would be here! I am sharing this everywhere and I will never call any other locksmith!

I called Myrtle Beach Locksmith and within an hour Eli was arriving to help me get back into my car & a new key made. Eli was very time efficient and completed the job in under a 1/2 hour. Super appreciative this isn’t one of the things that has to be complicated in getting everything back that was taken from me. You have my business if I ever need any type of locksmith services again.
